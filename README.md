# bootstrapPortfolio

This is my portfolio with links to past projects, my Linkedin account, and other places people can reach me.

## Problem
Portfolio was built simply with some native CSS, needed something greater to make look nicer.
Update: Portfolio has aged quite a bit as my skills have improved. Needs to be updated.

## Solution
Bootstrap was added and elements updated to improve look and design of portfolio.
Update: Code has been cleaned up, website too with new colors and text and styling.

### Technology Used
HTML, CSS, Bootstrap
